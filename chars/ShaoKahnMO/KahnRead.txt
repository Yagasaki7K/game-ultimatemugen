RELEASE 1.0 (First Public)

BY Mike Obrecht (Obreck2@britpost.com)
for WinMUGEN (DosMugen compatiable scripts included)


STUFF YOU NEED TO KNOW
-----------------------------------
He has all the required Sprites
Has all his MK2 and MK3 Taunts
Has Boss Physics: Kahn does not fall over when tripped, cannot be thrown*,
  and is very hard to knock off his feet.
Has new moves.
Has a Super Boss version.
MK2 style death!
	

*: certain characters like Zangief that depend highly on throws 
   can still throw Kahn ;). If you have a HIGHLY THROW DEPENDANT
   character you think should be added to the list of exceptions
   drop my an e-mail. Just make sure I haven't made them able to
   throw Kahn already.

WHAT'S NEW
-----------------------------------
First Public Release

KAHNTHRONE.DEF
-----------------------------------
This is a special version of Kahn that has a intro designed only to be
used on DoorHenge's Kahn's Arena stage.(Included.Use KArena.def not KArena2.def).
Try in out by starting a match with this version of Kahn on that stage.
Kahn must be on player2's side.

KAHN's ARENA STAGE
------------------------------------
Included is an arcade port of Shao Kahn's MK2 stage. It was given to me by
DoorHenge to go with my Shao Kahn years ago when I originally intended to
release him

KARENA.def has Kahn's throne empty. Use for Kahn is you use his KAHNTHRONE.DEF
version

KARENA2.DEF has Kahn sitting in his throne. Makes little sense if your fighting
Kahn, unless its supposed to be his clone or something. Good for a random
stage or fighting Kintaro.

TO DO LIST
-----------------------
Fix any bugs that come up.
Fatalities (Maybe. Kahn already has the code for a fatality system, but its
  disabled for now)

TO MAKE HIM WORK FOR DOSMUGEN
-----------------------------------------
Take the files out of Kahn's "DOSMugen" folder and move them to his main 
folder, overwrite the windows version of those files.

Kahns Fireball is less impressive on the Dos version.

Due to WinMugen changing the basic block scripts dramticly, there was no
way to make a single version of Kahn that works for both the Dos and 
Windows version.

COMMENTS
-----------------------
- To enable the hold back block, open AI.cns and add ;'s to the 
  first two states.
- Due to the fact that there's an SNK wrestler named Raiden, MK Raiden may
  be able to throw Kahn due to name confusion. Just blame it on him being
  a god.
- If the stages don't work for WinMugen, create a folder in the stages folder
  called stages and move the KArena.sff file there. WinMugen can be wierd
  about this.

OTHER INFO (READ THIS)
-----------------------
- Kahn's has boss physics. This make him extremely resistent to being
  knocked off his feet. Trip moves register as low hits instead and other
  knockup attacks may only knock him off balance instead of up in the
  air if they weren't meant to send him very high.
- Sometimes Kahn's AI takes a second to "kick in". This is Elecbyte's
  problem, not mine, as the current version of Mugen has no real 
  "AI trigger" so I'm forced to hack it in.
- One of the best ways of beating Kahn is to play defensively. Kahn's
  AI is based on punishing aggressive opponents so its best to wait
  for him to leave himself open before attacking.
- Don't even try to kill Kahn by pelting him with fireballs from a
  distance...
- The Super AI Kahn has a special death sequence based on the way he dies
  in MK2

SUPER A.I.
-----------------------
When the A.I. controlled Kahn is defeated a round, he goes beserk next
round. He gains new moves and supers and is even more resistent to
knockup moves.
