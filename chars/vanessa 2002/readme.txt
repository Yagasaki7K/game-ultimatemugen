                             FAREWELL

This is the last character you can expect to see from me.  I've had
my fill of MUGEN and no longer have any drive to continue working
on it.  Vanessa sat at 95% completion for some ten weeks before I
finally decided to just give it up, and as such, I passed her on to
Sander, who is also assuming control of Benimaru and Saisyu.  This
version is primarily done in my traditional KOF style, with some of
Sander's personal touches.  He may release an "X-ified" version
later, but any bug reports or anything to do with this character
should now be addressed to him, not to me.  Thank you, and
goodnight.

Crazy Puncher                  qcb,hcf + P

When performed while flashing after a POW Explode, these moves
will become Super Desperation Moves and inflict much more damage.

****** Miscellaneous ******
POW Explode                    X+Y+A
  Activates MAX meter.  While meter is active and Benimaru is
  flashing, he does an added 25% damage.  Any DMs performed
  in MAX become SDMs and are much more powerful.

Knockdown Attack 
  (ground or air)              A+B
  Can be used while blocking (only in MAX) to counter
  opponent's move.  Doing so will drain the MAX meter slightly.

Forward Roll                   X+Y
Backward Roll                  back + X+Y
  Either can be used while blocking (only in MAX) to escape
  opponent's move.  Doing so will drain the MAX meter slightly.
