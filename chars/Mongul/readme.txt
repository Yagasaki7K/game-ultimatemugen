Mongul Mugen Character by Jeff and Magus 
http://www.scruffydragon.com (click on the adds ;) )
Beta Version  0.80
Got it from http://www.scruffydragon.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known as one of the galaxy's vilest despots, Mongul's rise to power started as a young boy on his homeworld.
Mongul grew older and stronger, seeking out that which could make him stronger still. He arrived on Warworld, 
a planet sized engine of destruction created ages ago by a technologically advanced species. 
Warworld was indeed powerful, but even Mongul could not rule it alone. 
At some point, Mongul was fitted with an energy weapon. The amulet was surgically attached to Mongul's chest and, 
for reasons not revealed, was needed for his survival.

This character has only been tested over Winmugen if it doesn't work on Dos or Linux it is not my problem, I can't play on any of those.

VERY IMPORTANT
----------------------------------------------

Please, people owner of Mugen comunities:
- I dont like the unauthorized backups on anothers servers, I paid my own hosting and my server has the potency 
  to allow a lot of downloads, so, please dont upload this character somewhere else. Avoid that I take the decition of
  never release a newer version of the char or another of my chars, and that will be a shame because I have a 
  lot of good wips.
- Once I said that, it is useless email me for request of permissions for host my characters on another place.
- Also dont direct link to the file of my host. Link to the main page.

About Permission of use the sprites of Mongul. 
- You can take  all the sprites of Thanos, Zangief and Hulk that are in the packs that are hosted on mugenchina you don't take stuff from the sff.
- The sprited edits, can't be used.
- Please don't steal the character code or sprites, always ask for permission, or this one will have the same fate that Batman. (No public updates).
- Ask nicely and maybe I'll back you up in your projects......maybe......
