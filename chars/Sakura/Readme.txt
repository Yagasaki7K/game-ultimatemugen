===============<Gameplay Notes>===============

- You can only cancel Lv1 Supers and Lv2 Supers into others that aren't Lv3 Supers, even if
your partner's power bar has more than three stocks;

- During Excel Combo, you can cancel any connecting normal attack into any attack, and any
connecting special attack into any special or super attack;

- During Excel Combo, you can only spend power (e.g. perform EX and Super moves) while Sakura
is flashing faster;

- Sakura's attack power increases along with her power bar. If you have three (or more) power
stocks it increases 5%, two stocks increases it 2% and one stock 1%;

- If you hit an opponent while he's attacking, you'll do 20% extra damage; you'll know this
happened when the screen briefly pauses and flashes white;

- Nekketsu Hadouken is an unstable projectile, if it gets hit by another projectile it will
shatter into multiple fragments, each capable of hitting opponents;

- Sakura Otoshi can hit projectiles to make Sakura jump over them;

- During Sakura Jime a power struggle occurs, and both you and your opponent can mash buttons
to increase/decrease the number of hits;

- Sakura Jime is replaced with an alternate throw when against small chars;



===============<Tips and Tricks>===============

- Some attacks can hit lying down opponents, so don't give them any time to rest >=)

- Zero Counter is probably the best ability CAPCOM ever made up, it can easily turn the tables
so don't be afraid to use it;

- Use Excel Combo to start a long combo, then finish it with a Super Cancel;

- Use Sakura Otoshi to counter projectiles;



===============<Other Info>===============

- Her stage is available at my Stages section.


<<<<<Selecting the win pose>>>>>
(Speech translations by Kao Megura)

X -> Sakura raises her arm, laughing, while the wind ruffles her clothes. Ryu's win pose.
Y -> Sakura starts dancing.
Z -> Sakura does a couple of kicks and one of her shoes flies off. She then yells and the shoe
hits her in the head.
A -> Sakura does a couple of kicks and yells.
B -> Sakura wipes the sweat from her face, waves her hand and says "Kono toko da ne!" ("That's
how it's done!").
C -> Sakura crosses her arms and looks away while the wind ruffles her clothes. Ryu's win pose.

Start -> Kei comes running and one of two things happens:
- She trips and falls on her face
- She starts dancing along with Sakura


<<<<<Extra win poses>>>>>

Win by Shun Goku Satsu -> Sakura has her back turned to the screen and says "Kono toko da ne!".
Kei looks at Sakura's opponent and runs away scared.
