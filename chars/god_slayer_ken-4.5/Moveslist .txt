Most hyper moves have 3 levels of strenght and some have 4 levels. Light punch or light kick for lv 1, medium punch or kick lv2 you got the idea.

Lv 4 moves can only be performed when life is below 500 and power iguals 3000. These moves are a little more powerfull or have some other advantage. For instance, lv4 shin hadouken can be delayed if you keep holding strong punch. Lv 4 shouryureppa reaches farther etc.

Fatality only works when you kill your opponent using some of the lv 3 or lv4 hyper moves. Resurrection is an ability that only the cpu has. It happens whenever you kill GSK and his power bar is 1000 or above.
