CHARACTER PROFILE & BACKGROUND
=========================================================================

Name: Flint Marko
Occupation : Professional Criminal , Avenger, mercenary
Alias:  Sylvester Mann, Quarryman, William Baker 
Birthplace: Queens, NY - USA
Height: 6' 1" 
Weight: 240 lbs 
Eyes: Brown 
Hair: Brown 



Source:  www.marveldatabase.com

William Baker was born and raised in a rough neighborhood of New York City.
Baker learned to steal at an early age, and cheated and bluffed his way through school. 
After landing steady work as a henchman for a gang that ran protection rackets, Baker adopted the name Flint Marko. 

Pursued by the police Marko sought refuge at a nuclear test site near Savannah, Georgia.
He was lying on a nearby beach when an experimental reactor's steam system exploded, bombarding him with
a massive dose of radiation. 
After a short period of unconsciousness, Marko awoke to find that he could transform
his body into an animated, sand-like substance. 
Now able to elude the authorities with ease, Marko embarked on a criminal career that brought him into conflict first 
with Spider-Man, who defeated him by sucking him into a industrial vacuum cleaner.

The Sandman's criminal career crumbled when he joined forces with Hydro-Man
In a freak mishap, the Sandman and Hydro-Man combined to form a grotesque, mud-like monster. 
The authorities subdued the creature and decided to seal the substance in a container and dispose of it. 
The mud spontaneously separated into the two criminals, who burst free of their container. 

The ordeal so traumatized the Sandman that he decided to reform, using his powers for mankind's benefit. 
Though there was a period of speculation among the general populace as to whether his intentions were sincere, 
he gained the public's trust and joined the Wild Pack, an international team of mercenaries commanded by Silver Sable.. 
The Sandman even became a probationary member of the Avengers, Earth's Mightiest Heroes. 

Recently,after some fights with his different aspects and personalities, the Sandman abandoned his good side completely.
He is a criminal and seems to lack any desire to become a hero or do good. 



Powers and abilities:

*SAND CONVERSION: Apparently, he can also convert common grains of sand around him into constituents of his body.
In this manner, he can increase his overall size and volume (to some as yet unknown limit), or that of his limbs. 

*SUPERHUMAN STRENGHT: The Sandman is a superhuman being who is able to lift (press) up to 85 tons under standard conditions

*DENSITY CONTROL:  the Sandman can become as hard as sandstone, or disperse his body so that he becomes invulnerable to physical attacks. 

*SHAPE-SHIFTING: He can shape his  body into any shape he can imagine, including his forearms into weapons like hammers, spiked maces, and large fists, stretching, elongating, deforming, etc

*SAND BLASTS: He can project his sand particles outward at high speeds and, when in the shape of a bulky object, with the impact of a large sandbag. 

*GLASS GENERATION: He can alter the formation of his sand particles and reshape them into glass. This grants him the ability to reflect light and energy off of him.

===================== ABOUT THIS WIP  ============================================

LOGANIR:
So way back in 2005 McCready request  some help about his Sandman wip, and here we are after all that time 
of hard work doing this character. That's a long journey where we develop a brand new set of hypers, 
specials and attacks to finish this character.  I like to think we inspire each other when creating stuff for Sandman. 
Thanks for letting me join you in this dream buddy!   I just want say developing Sandman with McCready was very fun
and hope everybody enjoy playing with him on mugen.


McCREADY:
This character was innicially started by me (McCready) for the Fantastic Four project lead by Kalangueb.
After working on him for some time he was stopped for some years because I had other easier wips going on.
It was only when I joined mugenesis that I made a topic saying that I wanted to continue him, but I needed help.
Loganir as the great friend he is started working with me on this project and I can't thank him enought. Because
of him, this character is so much more than it was ever going to be. The quality of his sprites, ideas and code
are beyond normal. Thanks, buddy!

Just a quicky if you all are curious how Sandman was made. Frankensprited Shigen and Venom... 
painted them brown and added photoshop's film grain filter. There u go!
