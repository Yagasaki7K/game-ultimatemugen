-Are there any differences between the Dos version and the Windows version?
-The two versions are exactly the same. The only difference is that in WinMugen the AI's activation is slower because of some system changes.

-His AI isn't very competitive!
-Remember that this isn't a complete char, I'll make it stronger as I upgrade the char! But I don't want it to be stronger than EvilKen\EvilRyu's one.

-There are not many moves!
-They are coming, it's still not a complete char now.

-He is too serious to be Dan!!

Premium Sign: qcf + kick
Dan picks up a portrait and signs it. Then he throws it to the opponent.
But, what happens? The portrait keeps flying, and it keeps following Dan's opponent!
That's because there is a ghost inside, and, as it hits the opponent, it will come out and hit him with a SpecialMove that changes depending from the strength of the kick you pressed!

--------------------------->
Tips and Tricks:

Taunt! Dan's defense increases after his taunt so slip one in every round to keep the upper hand.

When you throw a portrait, it's a usefull tactic to let it go towards the opponent, so it will come back and hit him from behind!

Dan's hadouken is mainly used to get closer to the opponent. Try throwing a slow hadouken then ashura warping forward to get behind the opponent.

Super cancel! You never know when your next chance to combo the opponent into a super combo will be, so when you do hit succesfully, try to burn all your levels.

Stay out of corners! Corners are any player's worse enemy. Use Dan's Hadouken/Ashura warp crossup to get you out.

Don't stay defensive! Use Dan's alpha counter's turn the tables! Back to down motion and attack will use up one level of your super bar. Counter with punch does an invulnerable dragon punch, counter with kick does a strong dakkukiaku.

Recover! Do not let yourself be juggled mercilessly by your foes, make use of the air/ground recovers whenever possible.

Want to learn new combos? Watch the AI in action! Make use of EvilDan's air throws to perform loooong combos! (as for EvilKen)
