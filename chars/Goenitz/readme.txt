-----------------------[Introduction]---------------------------

Goenitz (*0).  Goenitz is one of the Four Heavenly Kings of 
Orochi, and controls the element of Wind. He is the man who broke 
the seal that was imposed on the Orochi power 1800 years ago, by 
the Kusanagi and the Yagami. It is unknown about the past and 
origins of Goenitz. It has been only recently when the world 
shaked at the demostration of his power.
