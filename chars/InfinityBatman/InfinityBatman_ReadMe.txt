Unofficial History: Having witnessed at a young age the murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne became driven to use his wealth and resources in order to rid Gotham City of evil. After traveling the world learning from the greatest masters, Bruce returned home to his Butler Alfred and mansion in Gotham where he developed the Batman persona and soon became a vigilante law enforcer. 

Through the course of time Batman has trained young apprentices who would take the guise of Robin and fight crime alongside Batman. Batman has also joined earth's heroes to form the Justice League. During the day, Bruce Wayne is a billionaire industrialist but at night he is Batman, protector of the innocent.
