 Background Info:

 One of the three Kazama brothers. Kazuki was taught the ways of Ninjitsu
 at an early age, and continued his training until now. He possesses the
 powers of fire. The source of these powers is his sword, Suzaku. He has
 a incredible hidden potential, and sometimes this transforms him into a
 savage entity. This worried his older brother Sogetsu, and was the begi-
 nning of the rivalry between him and Kazuki. Sogetsu is determined to
 destroy Kazuki's power. Kazuki doesn't like this situation. 
 Kazuki abandoned his ninja clan to rescue his sister Hazuki from Amakusa. 
 in Samurai Spirits 4. He is quick to lose his temper, but he is a young man
 filled with passion. Despite he is pursued by his brother, he refuses to 
 hate him. He hopes someday the solution to this problem will come. Simpati-
 zes most with his beloved sister, Hazuki.
