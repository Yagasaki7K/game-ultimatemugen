Iceman 1.2a for MUGEN 04.14
First release: 8/13/2022
============================================

Sources:
X-Men:COTA
Marvel vs. Capcom

======================================================================
System:
Iceman is a 6-button character, like most Capcom fighters. 

In case you don't know the layout, here's how it works:

    x y z
    a b c

x = Light Punch	  y = Medium Punch   z = Strong Punch
a = Light Kick    b = Medium Kick    c = Strong Kick

COMMANDS:

Dash: Double tap forward or backward. 

Push Block: Press two punch buttons while blocking a hit.

Recovery Roll: B, DB, D, and any button while falling.

Throw: While right next to your opponent, press forward or backward and a punch (Medium, Strong)
button. 

Air Throw: While next to your opponent in midair, press forward or backward and a punch (Medium/
Strong) button.

Special Air Attacks - While jumping, press down and HP for a downward iceball projectile, or down and
HK for an overhead kick.

------------==========================================================------------------------
---|>SPECIALS<|---
 
Legend: (D = Down, DF = Down-forward, F = forward, B = back... you get the idea)

------------------------------------------------------------------

Ice Beam - D, DF, F, Punch (ground/air)
           
Iceman shoots out a beam that freezes his opponent solid.  The X button aims down, Y straight ahead,
and Z upward.

----------------------------

Ice Boulder - Same power punch + kick

A huge boulder of ice is created above the opponent, and it crashes down on them, doing considerable
damage.  LP+LK causes it to move toward Iceman, MP+MK makes it fall straight down, and HP+HK makes
it fall away.

----------------------------

Ice Fist - D, DB, B, Punch

After pausing for a moment, Iceman adds a big ball of ice to the end of his fist.  This causes his
punch attacks to do more damage, until the ball shatters.

========================================================
---|>HYPER COMBOS<|----

aka Super Moves.  Both require one level of energy.
--------------------------------------------------------

Arctic Attack - D, DF, F, Punch

Iceman shoots out dozens of icy projectiles from his chest.

-----------------------------------

Avalanche - D, DF, F, Kick

Gigantic ice shards fall from the top of the screen.

================================================================================
SPECIAL NOTES:
---------------------------------------
-> Due to his damage control code, Iceman is *not* recommended for simultaneous teamplay.
-> Arctic Attack will not work properly in post-0414 version of MUGEN.

Thanks To:

-> Razoola and CPS2Shock (http://cps2shock.retrogames.com) for their tireless efforts
   that eventually led to the emulation of Capcom's CPS-2 arcade hardware.
-> Barry Rodewald, author of Q-Player.  An extremely helpful tool for sound ripping.
-> CrashTest and NeoGouki for SFMAME.  I can't begin to think of how painful this character
   would have been to make without such a useful tool.
-> Ragnarok Nemo for the AWESOME all-in-one MUGEN character editor, MEE.  It saved me a lot 
   of time and trouble.  And thanks for that AIR editor!
-> Capcom, for continuing to put out enjoyable 2D fighting games.
-> Elecbyte, for producing MUGEN - of course.  Now how about that Win32 version? ;)
