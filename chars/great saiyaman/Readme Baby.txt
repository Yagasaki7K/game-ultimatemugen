Character's History

The great saiyaman is an alternative clothes of Gohan...
Son Gohan is a fictional character originally published by Shueisha and Bird Studio in 1989. 
Created by Akira Toriyama for the Dragon Ball manga, Gohan makes his debut appearance in volume #17, or the premier episode of its animated adaptation,
Dragon Ball Z. In the series, Gohan is the first son of the primary protagonist, Son Goku, and his wife, the Ox princess named Chi Chi. 
Gohan was the first Saiyan/Human hybrid in the series, and as a result, has unusual physical abilities. Gohan was named after Goku's adoptive 
grandfather, and is a pun on the Japanese word for cooked rice or meal.

CAUTION:

All the fx and sprites made by Dgz Team is NOT OPEN SOURSE
If you want use fxs like auras, charges kames, kames, masenko, explosion, and others original stuff, YOU MUST TO HAVE
MY PERMISSION(NACHONAL).
If you use the fxs without my permission you will have problems.
Sorry but we want originality and own style to do mugen stuff...

My opinion: The open sourse is good for newbies and for use a few classic stuff... 
BUT if you're pretend to use all open sourse key, then you're a weak guy without originality... 
you're killing mugen and abuse the works of others cool guys. just PATHETHIC....
My recomendation: learn to do your own stuff.

----- Not to forget -----


Mugen is fun, but when u get older... u'll noticed that there's more important stuff than just mugen... 
enjoy while u can, don't be so hard to people who create their own chars using somebody else's codes... 
let others be the judge how good the char will be... 
u guys can't be angry forever just because of this small thing rite...

The brickbats anybody put on me, it's ok... i don't really mind, different people different opinions

To newbies... just be creative... and don't abuse... 

Thank you all... ;)
