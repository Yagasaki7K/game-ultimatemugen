 CHARACTER BIOGRAPHY 
---------------------

Cyclops (Scott Summers) is a fictional character, a superhero that is the field leader of the X-Men in the Marvel Comics Universe. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963) and was originally dubbed Slim Summers. By #3, his name was changed to Scott and Slim was referred as a nickname. A mutant, Cyclops produces powerful "optic blasts" from his eyes, forcing him to wear specialized glasses at all times and a specialized visor in combat. His powers may have led to his inhibited, meticulous character. These same qualities, however, have made him an ideal leader for the X-Men. He is the son of Corsair, the brother of Havok and Vulcan, the father of Cable, Marvel Girl, and X-Man, and the widower of Jean Grey.

The first student recruited by Charles Xavier and one of the original five X-Men, Cyclops has had a large presence in X-Men-related comics since their inception. He has also been featured in almost every adaptation of the team in other media.

In 2006, IGN.com rated Cyclops #1 on their list of Top 25 X-Men from the past forty years.[1]

In practically every incarnation of the character, he has almost always been shown to be not only Charles Xavier's most loyal student, but also the one who most believes in his dream of mutant and human equality. His loyalty to Xavier has cost him dearly from time to time, yet the character remains by Xavier's side. In turn, Xavier is known to view Scott as one of his most (if not the most) prized pupils, and looks upon Scott not as a mentor to mentee, but rather as a father to a son.

 CHARACTER INFORMATION 
-----------------------

Cyclops is based off of his VS Series and Co-op Appearance from the games listed at the top. He has a 6 button layout LP, MP, HP, LK, MK, HK and is custom made with the Moves from the MUA and XML2 games, meaning he has some stuff that he didn't originaly have in the VS Series that i thought would be a great addition to his gameplay. Speaking of gameplay he is MVC2 Style but has all of the MVC2, MUA and XML2 System works, which includes:

- Guard
- Chain Combo
- Air Chain Combo
- Super/Hyper Combo Cancel
- Cancel Any Move

- Run
