2- Random notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since her Diamond Edge  SDM uses lot of projectiles, it was impossible to put
juggle limits. So there you have a Kula with cheap SDM. :P

You can open the SFF file and change the big 2002 portrait to the 2000 one.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3- System
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic moves:
-----------


Kula 's system is simple, she rolls like in KOF96~98/2K~2K3, she hasn't got
any extra modes (armor mode and counter mode) nor the advanced mode.
Well, she works like all my KOF chars.

You can run, you can "long jump", "short jump" too. You can recover instead
of falling on the floor after some attacks.

To roll forward, press weak punch + weak kick. To roll backward, do the
same command, but hold back.
Emergency escape use 1 power bar, you just dodge during you guard an
attack.

Knock down attacks can be done by pressing both strong attacks at the
same time. If you do it during you block an attack, it will use 1 Power bar
but will send your opponent pretty far.

The counter system works like KOF, since I used Sander 's code (with permission)
since I made Kusanagi. Though I didn't add the "COUNTER" explod.


Hypers attacks:
--------------

A Hyper attack requires 1 Power bar.
A stress shot requires 2 Power bars.

And the desperation moves requires 3 Power bars.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4- Movelist
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X Y Z   start
A B C

I'll use the Arcade language for the movelist. So:
A = weak punch (X in Mugen)
B = weak kick (A in Mugen)
C = strong punch (Y in Mugen)
D = strong kick (B in Mugen)

5- Who?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Who is Kula? (as I see her)


 Was on mission to kill K' in Kof2000. But later her mission changed to destroy
the Proton Cannon.... I mean the ZERO Cannon.

 In Kof2001 Kula was back with a team, still to kill K', but her friend Foxy got
killed by K9999, then Kula got friend with K'.

 In Kof XI she teams up with K' and Maxima. Diana is still around her.
