COMMENTS
-----------------------
If he seems cheap its because he is! He was ment to be a boss.
There's a variation of the punch in half fatality: Tap z as Kintaro roars.

TO MAKE HIM WORK FOR DOSMUGEN
-----------------------------------------
Take the files out of his "DOSMugen" folder and move them to his other 
folders, overwriting the windows version files of the same name.

Due to WinMugen changing the basic block scripts dramticly, there was no
way to make a single version of him that works for both the Dos and 
Windows version.

Kintaro's fireball is of better color quality in his WinMugen version.
