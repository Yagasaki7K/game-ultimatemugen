     I hope you gamers really enjoy my creations, because there are not a lot of good playable characters out there. I find myself being a great VS style player, so my creations are VS style. Sorry if its not your TYPE.  

Tons of new stuff. you find them!



Here are a list of a "few" new things:


Pummel Supper : B,D,DB, x+y (Wait for (! ) then enter)

D,D,a: "Shovel Shivers" 
D,D z: "Nephew Pummel"

Supers:



New Easy Selection changes most specials commands to double tap of any button, and two button supers. Chain combo still descends, but requires less button changes. Expl. pressing x,x,x gives you jab,medium, fierce.


    I'd like to add that with out the brilliant work of these creators, certain aspects of my characters would probably not be as refined:

    BB Hood's Push Blocking which is copied exactly and, the AI activation and guard modes are, I believe his. (http://a-and-f.mainpage.net)
   
    Splode. Well I'd like to say that it was Splodes Rouge which got my started developing for Mugen. In fact my first attempts at creating a character for Mugen used Rouge as a template. 
    There may be a few hints of similarities still hanging around in Popeye. Well thanks for provided such great work guys. 

    Well, thanks again BBHood!




And Last but not least, I'd like to give a shout out to Daniel Tatro. Thanks for the excelent beta testing!
