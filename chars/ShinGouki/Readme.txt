<Selecting the win pose>

Y or B -> Gouki turns his back and says one of two possible speeches: "Shoushi!" (Ridiculous!)
or "Haji to shirei!" (You're a disgrace!);
Z or C -> Gouki stomps the ground, surrounded by an aura and making the whole screen shake
while saying "Orokana!" (You fool!).


<Extra win poses>

Win by Misogi -> Gouki turns his back and says "Shoushi!" (Ridiculous!);
Win by Shun Goku Satsu -> Gouki has his back turned with his kanji glowing, says "I am the
Master of the Fist!" and a special background appears.

=====<Version History>=====

<14.12.08>
- Hyakki Shuu throws can now juggle
- Senpuu Kyaku is no longer an overhead
- No longer uses Custom.st file
- Can no longer OTG after Misogi
- Some more general system fixes
- Opponent can now Tech Hit throws
- Applied SF4's command shortcuts to Shun Goku Satsu, you can now also do it as "x, x, F + a + z"
- Using crouching kicks to OTG now makes the opponent land on his feet, and is limited to a
certain number of times

<v.2.7>
- No longer glitches Catwalk
- Jigoku Fuusha now always shows its miss anim
- Taunt knocks down again
- Fixed a mistake that made Tenma Shinzui Heki automatically face P2
- Cleaned up the Kongou Kokuretsu Zan sprite edits a bit
- Can now cancel into Zenpou Tenshin, Hyakki Shuu and Tenma Shurettou
- Tenma Shinzui Heki deals even less damage, because you can add any attack after it to reach
or even surpass Lv1 Super damage, not to mention resetting air combos to the ground
- Can no longer use more than one Gou Shoryuken in a juggle (previously combos like 
Shoryuken -> Super -> Shoryuken were too powerful), unless of course you use Tenma Shinzui Heki
to get a free juggle
- Changed the damage of his main specials to CFJ values, SFZ2 values (or was it 3...) were too
high considering what my version can do
- Special intro versus my Nash
- Fixed priority on Tenma Shurettou, it previously sometimes lost to the opponent's attack, now
it'll always either beat it or trade hits


<v.2.6>
- Kongou Kokuretsu Zan can no longer be air guarded
- Easier air combos
- Jumping Fierce and Roundhouse knock down the opponent in combos
- Tatsumaki Zankuu Kyaku now has a short invulnerability time as it starts
- Back dash is now a bit longer
- Tenma Shinzui Heki now works better at starting/extending combos and has less recovery time,
but also does a lot less damage
- Tweaked the hit velocities on strong Shoryuken moves so that you can't follow them up before
the opponent touches the ground
- All aerial Super moves can now be done from Hyakki Shuu
- Can no longer be dizzied
- As a result from the damage changes I did to most of my older chars, his specials now do more
damage while his supers do less
- His taunt now only increases the damage for one hit, like in SF3 (doesn't work with Misogi
and projectiles though)
- Attacks now ignore juggle points when OTG'ing the opponent. I didn't spot any infinite caused
by this, but let me know if you do
- Changed how to combo from Hyakki Gou Sai, it can now only be canceled with Supers, but still
allows juggling with specials


<v.2.5>
- Tweaking, bug fixes and balance changes
- Made his A.I. a bit more like in his game appearances, you'll now see him using his specials
and supers mostly just to counterattack or combo


<v.2.33>
- Some fixes and tweaked stuff
- Added Negative Edge to Hyakki Shuu's variations
- Tenma Shurettou now counters attacks according to where they hit Gouki, not to their type
- Gouki now autofaces the opponent when Super Cancelling Tenma Shinzui Wari
- Re-added the MvC-style Tenma Gou Zankuu
- Shun Goku Satsu no longer deals damage according to the opponent's maximum life points
- Dhalsim can now break out of Shun Goku Satsu
- You can now mash buttons to prevent the opponent from breaking out of Shun Goku Satsu


<v.2.25>
- Some fixes and tweaked stuff
- Vega now has two possible speeches instead of just one
- Added super portrait for Lv3 Supers
- Added Jigoku Fuusha
- Added Tenshou Kaireki Jin
- Shun Goku Satsu now deals 60% damage to normal opponents and 80% to evil characters (see
Other Info), no matter how much life and defence they have >=)
- Shun Goku Satsu can no longer be canceled from a connecting normal attack, but now it can 
from Ashura Senkuu
- Rugal can no longer evade Shun Goku Satsu, and now takes extra damage from it. God Rugal
remains the same though
- Tenma Shinzui Wari can now be done from Hyakki Shuu
- Changed a lot of guard flags
- Kongou Kokuretsu Zan's second half is now air blockable
- Added Negative Edge
- Added special intro vs my Vega
- Increased hitvels. Harder to chain now, but the char feels more solid and balanced
- Slightly increased Gou Shouryuu Ken's range, for smoother cancels
- Replaced Original Combo with Excel Combo
- Added Aerial Launcher when Excel Combo is active



=====<What's Missing>=====

- Remaking the char. Though maybe I'd just do a normal Gouki with more limited gameplay
instead, and leave this one with the combo craziness
