=====<Move Details>=====

- Head Press can be used as a pursuit attack, to hit downed opponents

- Psycho Banish can destroy normal and special projectiles

- Strenth of Vega Warp determines how far from his starting position he will end up. However,
Reversal Warp's target location depends on the opponent's position;

- You may delay Vega Warp for a bit if you keep holding two punch/kick buttons, but if you
delay it for too long Vega will cancel the move;

- If you fire a Psycho Field, and then get hit before it explodes, Vega loses control over it
and the projectile dissipates without harming the opponent;

- Psycho Crusher and Heartbreak Despair destroy normal projectiles. Psycho Break Smasher
destroys normal and special projectiles. Final Psycho Crusher destroys any projectile



=====<Changes since v.0.75>=====

- A lot of fixes and balance changes
- Psycho Crusher moves now destroy specific types of projectiles (see Gameplay Notes)
- Added Psycho Break Smasher
- No longer needs to charge Super moves during Excel Combo
- Added (sloppy) A.I.
- Added some palettes
