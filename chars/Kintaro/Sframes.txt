***************Introducing the Obreck fatality frames******************

   **Note: Sorry about the rush job. I was trying to get Sub-Zero out
           as quickly as possible. I'll write a better version later.

-Skip down to "The half-assed way to add the Obreck Fatality Frames if-
-you want to quickly make a charater compatible to the spine ripper.  -
  
	As you may know if you've created any charaters in Mugen there 
  are no frames designated frames for a charater losing their head or
  being severed in half. While this causes no problems for most charaters
  ported to the game charaters from Mortal Kombat lose some of their more
  appealing fatalites because this (Or the person porting them has to
  come up with some creative way to fake it that looks terrible on many
  of Mugen massive charater line-up). I've decided to designate my own
  set of frames for the sequences in hopes that others will take advantage
  of it by making charaters with those frames and charaters with fatalities
  that also make use of them. If your just reading this because you 
  want favorite/most hated charater get their spine ripped out as 
  quickly as possible skip the next paragraph. It'll only confuse and
  discourage you. Scroll down to "The half-assed way to add the Obreck 
  Fatality frames to your charater" instead.

  	Anyways this trick designates you add 11 animation sequences in 
  your charater's .air file. I picked these numbers because I figured
  NO ONE in their right would need to use them for the charater's 
  standard animation. Anyways the animations you need to add are:


	- 29990  ;Charater's inanimate severed head. Used for things like
		  Subby's spine-ripper when he hold your head up like a
                  trophy. 1 frame. Number it 29990,0

	- 29991  ;Charater's severed head spinning. Used for when the
                  head is airborne charater's decaped head is airborne,
                  like in Johnny Cage's decap uppercut. Can have as many
                  animation frames as you want and the squence should be
                  allowed to loop. Number the most upright frame 29991,0

	- 29992  ;Charater's inanimate head lying on the ground. Used for
                  things like when the charater's head is just lying
                  there on the ground after Cage knocked their head off.
                  1 frame. Number it 29992,0

	- 29993  ;Charater's headless body keeling over. The body should
                  start standing and end up lying on the ground. Can 
                  have as many frames as you want as want but should 
                  be under 70 ticks and the last frame should 
                  have -1 on its animation time. Number 1st frame 29993,0
                  and the last 29994,0

	- 29994  ;Inanimate headless body lying on the ground. Should
                  look indenticle to the last frame in animation 29993.

	- 29995  ;Severed lower half of charater's body. Treat animating
                  it like animation 29993. Number 1st frame 29995,0 and
                  the last 29996,0. Make a duplicate frame for 29996,0
                  if you only used 1 frame for this squence.

 	- 29996  ;Inanimate severed lower half of body. Should look 
                  indenticle to the last frame in animation 29995.

	- 29997  ;Charater's severed upper body. Used in fatalites like
                  Cage's rip-in-half. Should start upright and end up 
                  lying on its back or stomach. Treat animating it like
                  in animation 29993. Number 1st frame 29997,0 and the
                  last 29998,0
  
 	- 29998  ;Inanimate severed upper half of body. Should look 
                  indenticle to the last frame in animation 29997.

	- 29999  ;Exacty like 29997 expect the sever upper body should
                  also be missing its head. for really gorey fatalities
                  where the opponent removes your head then chops you
                  in half. Number 1st frame 29999,0 and last 29989,0

 	- 29989  ;Inanimate severed and headless upper half of body.
                  Should look indenticle to the last frame in 
                  animation 29999.

	Well that's it for now. Look at Sub-Zero .air .sff and .cns file
  for more info or if you want to see how the speciallized fatalities work.
  Or if you have no fucking clue about anything I just said scroll down

****The Half-Assed approach to adding in the Obreck fatality frames********

Here is the quickest way to add the Obreck frames to your guy. Keep in
mind they will look a crappy "MK3 Paper doll" when a fataly that uses
the frames are done on them.

STEP 1: Get Mcm if you don't have in already. http://ses.mgbr.net

STEP 2: Open the charater's .sff file and find a frame of the charater where they're
        standing and look like they're in pain. Go to export image and save the image.

STEP 3: Open the image with an art editor. Make 5 copies of the image naming them:
        Head,Body,Lower,Upper,and UpperDecap.

STEP 4: Edit each image:
          Make Head just the charater's head. This is their decaped head.

          Remove the head from Body, leaving the rest. This is your decaped body.

          Remove everthing below the waist on Upper. This is your severed upper body.

          Remove everthing above the waist on Lower. This is your severed lower body.

          Make UpperDecap the same as upper, but with the head removed. This is your
            decapped/severed upper body

STEP 5: Get the frames axis's. Make them centered X-wise and where they would touch the 
        ground Y-wise. Make sure the images are saved as .pcx format. If the charater 
        has some CONSISTENT red in their palette feel free to dabble some blood on.

STEP 6: Open your guy's .sff file again in Mcm. Add Head.pcx in 3 times as 29990,0 29991,0 and
        29992,0. Add Body.pcx in 2 times as 29993,0 and 29994,0. Add Lower.pcx in twice as
        29995,0 and 29996,0. Add Upper.pcx in twice as 29997,0 and 29998,0. Finally add 
        UpperDecap.pcx in twice as 29999,0 and 29989,0. Save your .sff file and exit.

STEP 7: Copy and paste the lines of code below this step to the bottom of your charater's
        .air file and you're done! Load up a match with Sub-Zero and your guy and try Subby's
        spine ripper on them. Enjoy. Here's the lines of code:


; Trophy Head
[Begin Action 29990]
29990, 0,0,0,-1

; Airborne Head
[Begin Action 29991]
29991, 0,0,0,-1

29997, 0,0,0,-1

; Upper Body Lying on Ground
[Begin Action 29998]
29998, 0,0,0,-1

; Decaped Upper Body Dying
[Begin Action 29999]
29999, 0,0,0,-1

; Decaped Upper Body Lying on Ground
[Begin Action 29989]
29989, 0,0,0,-1
